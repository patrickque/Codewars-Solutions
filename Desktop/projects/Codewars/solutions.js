//// Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
// If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

// The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

// name + " plays banjo" 
// name + " does not play banjo"
// Names given are always valid strings.

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
    // Implement me
    return name;
  }

//solution

////  Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

//   Style Points
//   Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

//solution
const greet = () => "hello world!";


////Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

// invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
// invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
// invert([]) == []
// You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.


//solution
const invert = (arr) => arr.map(x => x * -1);


////Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.
// Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

//solution
const booleanToString = b => b ? 'true' : 'false';


////Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.
// For example:

// Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
// Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
// You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
