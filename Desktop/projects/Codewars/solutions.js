//solution

const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
  

//// Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
// If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

// The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

// name + " plays banjo" 
// name + " does not play banjo"
// Names given are always valid strings.

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
    // Implement me
    return name;
  }

//solution 

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
    if (typeof name === 'string') {
        if (name.charAt(0) === 'R' || name.charAt(0) === "r"){
            return name + " plays banjo";
        } else {
            return name + " does not play banjo";

////  Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

//   Style Points
//   Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

//solution
const greet = () => "hello world!";


////Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

// invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
// invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
// invert([]) == []
// You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.


//solution
const invert = (arr) => arr.map(x => x * -1);


////Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.
// Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

//solution
const booleanToString = b => b ? 'true' : 'false';


////Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.
// For example:

// Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
// Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
// You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
class SmallestIntegerFinder {
    findSmallestInt(args) {
      
    }
  }

//solution
class SmallestIntegerFinder {
    findSmallestInt(args) {
      return Math.min(...args);
    }
  }

//// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

//solution
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`



//// Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.
// For example:
// summation(2) -> 3
// 1 + 2
// summation(8) -> 36
// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

//solution
var summation = function (num) {
  let result = 0 
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++){
    result += i
  }
  return result
}

////Can you find the needle in the haystack?

// Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

// After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

// "found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

// Example(Input --> Output)

// ["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
// Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"


//solution
function findNeedle(haystack) {
  let indexFound = haystack.indexOf('needle')
  return `found the needle at position ${indexFound}`
}


//// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
//  You're given one parameter, the original string.  You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.


//solution
function removeChar(str){
  let result = str.slice(1, -1)
  return result
}

//// Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.
// Use conditionals to return the proper message:
// case               	   return
// name equals owner	     'Hello boss'
// otherwise	             'Hello guest'


//solution
const greet = (name, owner) => name === owner ? 'Hello boss' : 'Hello guest'


////Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.
// Examples (Input -> Output)
// * [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
// * [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
// * [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
// * [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5
// Notes


//solution
const max = arr => {
  return Math.max(...arr)
}

const min = arr => {
  return Math.min(...arr)
}
